				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>Cloud Access Points (CAP) are a requirement for all DoD components utilizing cloud services.  Many cloud deployments will require components to deploy their own CAPs, as the forthcoming Enterprise CAP does not yet exist.</p>


				<h2>Your Solution</h2>
				<p>Cloud Science personnel have been key contributors to the design and fielding of numerous CAPs within DoD (including Navy, SOCOM, and DHA to date).  Let us help you get your CAP deployed on time to meet your mission objectives.</p>
