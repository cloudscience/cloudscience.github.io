				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>The AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a powerful tool in your cloud portfolio, but that same power and flexibility means hackers and programming errors can cost you real money. You need a way to know when your VPC environment changes, so you can be sure that you've approved every change. </p>


				<h2>Your Solution</h2>
				<p><b>VPC Watch</b> monitors your VPC 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, alerting you when changes occur so you can respond to them. 

				<h2>How VPC Watch Works</h2>
				<p>The first time VPC Watch checks your Virtual Private Cloud, it creates a digital fingerprint of your VPC environment and digitally signs that fingerprint so you can be sure it's authentic. VPC Watch then compares your environment to the fingerprint every few minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and notifies you when a change is detected.</p>


				<p>VPC Watch monitors over 25 specific data points for change, including:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Running servers</li>
					<li>Security settings</li>
					<li>Firewall rules</li>
					<li>Routing tables</li>
					<li>VPN connections</li>
				</ul>

				<p> and many more.</p>
