				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>The AWS API provides your organization and its clients with a powerful way to programmatically manage your cloud resources. But as a reseller or enterprise organization, you want to ensure that faulty programs or poor communication don't result in overspending, potentially making you liable for those resource costs.  </p>


				<h2>Your Solution</h2>
				<p><b>API Sentry</b> applies authorization and financial checks to each of your AWS API calls, ensuring that only the changes you authorize are made, and only the dollars you approve are spent. 

				<h2>How It Works</h2>
				<p>API Sentry is a smart proxy that can check each AWS API call and enforce:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Spending limits <b>before</b> changes are made</li>
					<li>Granular security permissions</li>
					<li>Detailed audit logging for every change request</li>
				</ul>

				<p>API Sentry is transparent -- you won't have to change your programs or vendor tools to use it. Just configure a new AWS API endpoint and you're protected.</p>

				<h2>Licensing</h2>
				<p><b>API Sentry</b> is offered as a enterprise license that monitors an unlimited number of API calls. <a href="/contact.html">Contact us</a> for more information and a quote for your API Sentry installation.
